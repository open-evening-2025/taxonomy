      The client qualification process serves as the foundation for all space
      travel insurance policies.
      Agents must conduct three essential assessments:
      **Medical Assessment:** Clients must undergo specialized aerospace medical
      evaluation that examines cardiovascular response to microgravity, bone
      density measurements, and vestibular system sensitivity. These assessments
      must be conducted by our partnered aerospace medicine specialists and
      documented in our system.
      **Psychological Evaluation:** Our standardized Space Psychology Assessment
      Protocol (SPAP) evaluates
      isolation tolerance, group dynamics compatibility, and stress response
      patterns. Clients for missions exceeding 30 days require additional
      psychological profiling focused on long-term isolation effects.
      All evaluations must be completed by certified examiners with results
      properly documented.
      **Mission-Specific Qualification:** Agents must analyze the technical
      parameters of the client's intended
      space activity and match these with appropriate risk measures.

      - question: |
          What assessments are required for client qualification?
        answer: |
          Three essential assessments are required: Medical Assessment
          (examining cardiovascular response to microgravity, bone density, and
          vestibular
          system), Psychological Evaluation using the SPAP, and Mission-Specific
          Qualification that analyzes technical parameters of the client's space
          activity.
      - question: |
          What does the medical assessment for space travel insurance examine?
        answer: |
          The medical assessment examines cardiovascular response to
          microgravity, bone density measurements, and vestibular system
          sensitivity. These must
          be conducted by partnered aerospace medicine specialists and properly
          documented.
      - question: |
          What additional psychological profiling is required for longer
          missions?
        answer: |
          Clients for missions exceeding 30 days require additional
          psychological profiling specifically focused on long-term isolation
          effects, beyond the standard Space Psychology Assessment Protocol
          (SPAP).

      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the client qualification process?
        answer: |
          The qualification process isn't about excluding clients but about
          crafting precisely tailored protection based on scientific assessment
          of client-specific risks.
  - context: |
      **Mission Risk Profile (MRP):** Agents must develop a detailed profile
      identifying at least fifteen specific risk factors associated with the
      client's space activity. For SpaceX Fram2 participants, this includes
      risks related to experimental procedures, EVA activities, and scientific
      equipment
      interaction. The MRP must be cross-referenced with our Comprehensive
      Risk Database.
      **Coverage Configuration Session:** Agents must formally present
      appropriate coverage options addressing four categories: personal
      injury/medical response, equipment/vessel damage, mission failure
      contingencies,
      and third-party liability. Each category requires concrete examples of how
      coverage would respond to mission-specific scenarios.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is a Mission Risk Profile (MRP)?

          third-party liability.
  - context: |
      **Documentation and Pricing Transparency:** Throughout this process,
      agents must maintain detailed notes in our system and generate a Coverage
      Alignment Summary for client acknowledgment. The process concludes with a
      Premium Calculation Report that clearly illustrates how each coverage
      component
      contributes to the overall price.
      **Disclosure Package:** Agents must prepare comprehensive documentation
      including the Policy Document,
      Space Travel Risk Compendium, and Claims Procedure Manual specifically
      tailored to the client's mission.
      **Formal Review Session:** A minimum two-hour session must be conducted
      where agents verbally explain
      each major policy section, explicitly discussing mortality statistics,
      accident scenarios, and health
      risks specific to the mission profile. Clients must confirm understanding
      after each section.

  - context: |
      **Authentication and Specialized Documentation:** All documents require
      proper witnessing through notarization or our certified digital system.
      Clients must initial each page of risk disclosures.
      Missions involving experimental procedures require additional consent
      documentation with separate signatures.
      All legal documentation must be completed 45 days prior to launch. The
      informed consent process is not merely a legal formality but a crucial
      educational opportunity ensuring clients truly understand their risks and
      protections.
      These three processes must be implemented sequentially and completely,
      without abbreviation. Compliance is monitored through our Celestial
      Process Audit System, with monthly reports for each agent.
