  - context: |
      The **Emergency Severity Index (ESI)** is a 5-level triage system used to
      classify patients based on urgency.
      **Level 1** requires **immediate intervention** (e.g., cardiac arrest).
      **Level 2** indicates **high-risk conditions** (e.g., stroke symptoms).
      **Levels 3â€“5** involve stable patients with varying resource needs.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the levels of the Emergency Severity Index (ESI)?
        answer: |
          The ESI has five levels: Level 1 for immediate intervention
          needed, Level 2 for high-risk conditions, and Levels 3-5 for
          stable patients with different resource needs.
      - question: |
          What type of patient qualifies as ESI Level 1?
        answer: |
          Patients requiring immediate life-saving interventions, such as those
          experiencing cardiac arrest or severe trauma.
      - question: |
          How does the ESI help triage patients?
        answer: |
          It prioritizes patient care based on urgency and expected resource
          needs, ensuring critically ill patients receive
          immediate attention.
  - context: |
      **Vital signs** are crucial for evaluating triage priority.
      Abnormal **heart rate**, **respiratory rate**, or **blood pressure**
      may indicate a life-threatening condition requiring urgent intervention.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why are vital signs important in triage?
        answer: |
          Vital signs help assess the severity of illness.
          Abnormal readings may indicate
          urgent medical needs.
      - question: |
          What vital signs are assessed during triage?
        answer: |
          Common vital signs include heart rate, respiratory rate,
          blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
      - question: |
          How does hypotension affect triage decisions?
        answer: |
          Hypotension (low blood pressure) may indicate shock
          or internal bleeding,
          requiring urgent evaluation.
  - context: |
      **Pain assessment** plays a key role in determining triage priority.
      A **Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)** from **0 to 10** helps categorize
      pain severity and urgency of care.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why is pain assessment important in emergency triage?
        answer: |
          Pain severity can indicate potential underlying conditions that
          require urgent medical attention.
      - question: |
          How is pain measured during triage?
        answer: |
          Pain is often measured using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS),
          which ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).
      - question: |
          What types of pain are considered high-priority?
        answer: |
          Severe chest pain, uncontrolled abdominal pain, or sudden
          intense headaches may indicate critical conditions requiring
          urgent evaluation.
  - context: |
      **Respiratory distress** is a red-flag condition during triage.
      Symptoms like **shortness of breath, wheezing, cyanosis**
      (bluish skin), and abnormal lung sounds require immediate evaluation.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are signs of respiratory distress?
        answer: |
          Common signs include shortness of breath, wheezing,
          and cyanosis (bluish skin).
      - question: |
          What conditions can cause respiratory distress?
        answer: |
          Potential causes include asthma, pneumonia, chronic
          obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure.
      - question: |
          How is respiratory distress managed in triage?
        answer: |
          Patients with respiratory distress may receive oxygen
          therapy, bronchodilators, or urgent respiratory support.
  - context: |
      **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)** is used in triage to assess
      patient consciousness. Scores range from **3 (deep coma)**
      to **15 (fully alert)** based on **eye, verbal, and motor responses**.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)?
        answer: |
          The GCS is a neurological scale used to measure consciousness
          levels in emergency patients based on eye, verbal, and
          motor responses.
      - question: |
          What is a critical GCS score that indicates immediate intervention?
        answer: |
          A GCS score of **8 or below** suggests severe impairment and requires
          urgent airway management and neurological assessment.
      - question: |
          How does GCS help in emergency triage?
        answer: |
          GCS helps triage teams quickly determine the severity of head
          injuries and altered mental states, guiding critical treatment
          decisions.
