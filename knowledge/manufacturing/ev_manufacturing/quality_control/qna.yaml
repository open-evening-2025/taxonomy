  - context: |
      The **Battery Inspection Protocol (BIP)** is a 5-level inspection system
      used to classify battery components based on safety criticality.
      **Level 1** requires **100% inspection** (e.g., cell separators).
      **Level 2** indicates **high-importance components**
      **Levels 3â€“5** involve components with varying inspection requirements.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the levels of the Battery Inspection Protocol (BIP)?
        answer: |
          The BIP has five levels: Level 1 for critical cell components
          requiring 100% inspection, Level 2 for high-importance components
          with enhanced sampling, and Levels 3-5 for standard components
          with varying inspection requirements.
      - question: |
          What type of component qualifies as BIP Level 1?
        answer: |
          Components requiring 100% inspection, such as critical battery
          cell components like cell separators that directly impact safety.
      - question: |
          How does the BIP help prioritize quality control resources?
        answer: |
          It prioritizes inspection efforts based on component criticality and
          potential safety implications, ensuring the most critical components
          receive the most rigorous inspection.
  - context: |
      **Electronic systems verification** is crucial for evaluating component
      reliability.
      Abnormal **circuit load testing**, **signal integrity testing**,
      or **EMI/EMC testing**
      may indicate component failures that could affect vehicle performance.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why is electronic systems verification important in quality control?
        answer: |
          Electronic systems verification ensures vehicle control systems
          function reliably. System failures may compromise vehicle safety,
          powertrain performance, or user experience.
      - question: |
          What tests are used during electronic systems verification?
        answer: |
          Common tests include circuit load testing, signal integrity testing,
          EMI/EMC testing, and software validation.
      - question: |
          How does EMI/EMC testing affect quality control decisions?
        answer: |
          EMI/EMC testing verifies that electronic components function
          correctly in electromagnetic environments, preventing potential
          interference that could affect vehicle safety or performance.
  - context: |
      **Dimensional validation** plays a key role in determining component
      acceptability.
      An **Automated Vision System (AVS)** with accuracy to **0.05mm** helps
      categorize components as within or outside dimensional specifications.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why is dimensional validation important in EV manufacturing?
        answer: |
          Precise dimensions ensure components will fit correctly during
          assembly and function as designed under operating conditions,
          which is critical for battery safety and drivetrain efficiency.
      - question: |
          How are dimensions measured during inspection?
        answer: |
          Dimensions are often measured using Automated Vision Systems (AVS),
          which provide accuracy to 0.05mm for critical components.
      - question: |
          What dimensional features are considered high-priority?
        answer: |
          Critical battery cell alignment, motor assembly tolerances, and
          cooling channel dimensions are considered high-priority for
          dimensional validation.
  - context: |
      **Thermal performance testing** is essential during quality control.
      Methods like **thermal cycling, heat dissipation verification, thermal
      imaging analysis** and **environmental chamber testing** allow evaluation
      of temperature management systems.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are common thermal performance testing methods?
        answer: |
          Common thermal testing methods include thermal cycling,
          heat dissipation verification, thermal imaging analysis,
          and environmental chamber testing.
      - question: |
          What issues can be detected through thermal performance testing?
        answer: |
          Thermal testing can detect hotspots, insufficient cooling,
          thermal expansion problems, and heat management failures.
      - question: |
          How are thermal performance testing results documented?
        answer: |
          Thermal test results must be recorded with test parameters,
          documented with calibrated equipment, and stored for
          component traceability.
  - context: |
      **Vehicle Safety Rating (VSR)** is used in quality control to assess
      vehicle safety. Scores range from **0 (complete failure)**
      to **100 (exceeds specifications)** based on **component, system, and
      vehicle-level tests**.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the Vehicle Safety Rating (VSR)?
        answer: |
          The VSR is a scoring system used to assess overall vehicle
          safety and quality compliance based on component, system,
          and vehicle-level test results.
      - question: |
          What is a critical VSR score that indicates remediation?
        answer: |
          A VSR score of **70 or below** indicates a critical deficiency
          requiring remediation before vehicle release.
      - question: |
          How does VSR help in quality control?
        answer: |
          VSR helps quality teams evaluate overall vehicle safety
          and identify improvement opportunities through
          comprehensive analysis.
