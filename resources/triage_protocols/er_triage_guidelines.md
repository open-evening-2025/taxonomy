# Emergency Room Triage Guidelines

## Overview
Emergency room triage ensures patients receive care based on the urgency of their conditions. The **Emergency Severity Index (ESI)**, vital signs monitoring, pain assessment, respiratory distress evaluation, and the **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)** are critical components of triage decision-making.

---

## 1. Emergency Severity Index (ESI)
The **ESI** is a five-level triage system used to classify patients based on urgency and required resources.

### ESI Levels:
- **Level 1:** Immediate intervention needed (e.g., cardiac arrest).
- **Level 2:** High-risk conditions (e.g., stroke symptoms).
- **Level 3–5:** Stable patients with varying resource needs.

### Purpose:
The ESI system prioritizes patient care by assessing the severity of illness and expected resource utilization.

---

## 2. Vital Signs Monitoring
Vital signs provide essential information about a patient's stability and risk factors.

### Key Vital Signs:
- **Heart Rate** – High or low rates may indicate cardiac distress.
- **Respiratory Rate** – Elevated rates may signal respiratory failure.
- **Blood Pressure** – Hypotension may indicate shock or internal bleeding.
- **Oxygen Saturation** – Low levels may indicate hypoxia.

### Importance in Triage:
Abnormal vital signs may suggest life-threatening conditions requiring immediate intervention.

## 3. Pain Assessment
Pain evaluation helps identify critical conditions requiring urgent care.

### Pain Measurement Scale:
The **Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)** categorizes pain severity from **0 (no pain)** to **10 (worst imaginable pain).**

### High-Priority Pain Conditions:
- Severe **chest pain** (possible cardiac emergency).
- **Uncontrolled abdominal pain** (potential surgical emergency).
- **Sudden intense headaches** (possible neurological emergency).

---

## 4. Respiratory Distress Evaluation
Respiratory distress is a critical red flag during triage.

### Symptoms of Respiratory Distress:
- **Shortness of breath**
- **Wheezing**
- **Cyanosis** (bluish skin due to oxygen deprivation)
- **Labored breathing**

### Common Causes:
Conditions such as asthma, pneumonia, **COPD**, and heart failure may lead to respiratory distress.

### Management Strategies:
Patients with respiratory distress may require:
- Oxygen therapy
- Bronchodilators
- Urgent respiratory support

---

## 5. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
The **GCS** assesses neurological function in emergency patients.

### GCS Score Breakdown:
- **15:** Fully alert
- **<8:** Critical impairment requiring immediate airway management

### Purpose:
The GCS aids triage teams in evaluating head injuries and altered mental states, ensuring appropriate treatment.

---

## Conclusion
The **ESI system**, **vital signs assessment**, **pain evaluation**, **respiratory distress monitoring**, and **GCS analysis** are essential components of emergency triage. These guidelines help prioritize patient care and ensure timely medical intervention.
